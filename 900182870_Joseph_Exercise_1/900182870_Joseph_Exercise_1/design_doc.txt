The only assumption I made is that the person who is going to run this program will locate lab_1 directory in another directory called csce_3402 under the root
i.e. /root/csce_3402/lab_1/

My design decisions include:

1- I designed a verifying function for backup/restore that detects whether the user entered wrong/invalid parameters or parameters less than or more than the required.

2- I had to include that #!/bin/bash at the beginning of backup.sh file in order to indicate that this script is a bash script since "source" is a built-in bash function.

3- I had to write the full path before each script that I want to run because I was not running them from their directory. however, I run them from outer directories.

4- I decided to use symmetric encryption in order to decrypt the compressed archives using the same key provided for the through the backup

5- I had to include the full path for the backup file in the crontab file in order to be reached every hour and be excuted
