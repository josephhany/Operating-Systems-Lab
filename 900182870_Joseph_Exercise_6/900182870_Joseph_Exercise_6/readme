In order to generate the kernel module ".ko" file, you need to put the Makefile with version_print.c in the same directory and write the following:
--> make

Then in order to insert the kernel module, write the following:
--> sudo insmod ./fork_hook.ko

Then in order to check that the module has been inserted, run the following command:
--> lsmod

Then in order to see the messages printed in the log file, run the following command:
--> watch "dmesg | tail -20"

In order to remove the module, run the following command:
--> sudo rmmod fork_hook

To clear the log, use the following command:
--> sudo dmesg -c
