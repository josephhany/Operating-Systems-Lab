
In order to compile the test program with the wrappers, use the following command:

    g++ pfork_test_with_wrapper.c pfork.c -o pfork_test_with_wrapper.o

In order to run the test program, use the following command:

    ./pfork_test_with_wrapper

In order to compile the test program without the wrappers, use the following command:

    g++ pfork_test.c -o pfork_test.o

In order to run the test program, use the following command:

    ./pfork_test

In order to create the patch files, use the following command:

    diff -u file1.c file2.c > file.patch

- The patch files directory include all the patch files.
