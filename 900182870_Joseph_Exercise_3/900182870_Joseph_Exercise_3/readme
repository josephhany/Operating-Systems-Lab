In order to generate the kernel module ".ko" file, you need to put the Makefile with hello.c in the same directory and write the following:
--> make

Then in order to insert the kernel module without specifying values for the num and str variables (i.e. the program will only print "Hello World CSCE-3402 :)" one time) , write the following:
--> sudo insmod ./hello.ko

Then in order to check that the module has been inserted, run the following command:
--> lsmod

Then in order to see the messages printed in the log file, run the following command:
--> watch "dmesg | tail -20"

In order to remove the module, run the following command:
--> sudo rmmod hello

In order to print "This is CSCE-3402 kernel module" three times in the log file, you have to pass values for the variables defined inside the module. This can happen by running the following command:
--> sudo insmod ./hello.ko num=3 str='"This is CSCE-3402 kernel module"'

To clear the log, use the following command:
--> sudo dmesg -c
